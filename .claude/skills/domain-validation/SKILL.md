# Domain: Validation

## Summary
`BacktestEngine` validates recommendation accuracy using a rolling window approach; `OptimizationEngine` automates running many backtests to find the best parameter combination. Results are saved to `results/` as JSON.

## Data Flows

- **Backtest:** `BacktestEngine.run_backtest()` → iterates test months starting at index 3 → for each test month: calls `learn_sequences_up_to_month(test_month)`, then loops all teams → calls `recommender.recommend(team, prev_month, ...)` → checks improvements in `test_month`, `test_month+1`, `test_month+2` → accumulates accuracy, precision@N, recall@N, and MRR per month → returns overall values + matching random baselines for each
- **Optimization:** `OptimizationEngine.find_optimal_config()` → `generate_parameter_combinations()` yields dicts → for each: runs `run_backtest(config=combo)` → tracks best result → checks `_cancelled` flag every 10 teams and every month boundary → saves all results to `results/optimization_results_{timestamp}.json`
- **Cancellation:** `POST /api/optimize/cancel` → `APIService.cancel_optimization()` → `optimizer_engine.cancel()` → sets `_cancelled = True` → polled inside backtest loop → returns partial results dict with `cancelled: True`
- **Results persistence:** `OptimizationEngine.load_latest_results()` reads the most recent JSON file from `results/`; served by `GET /api/optimize/latest`

## Domain Validation Rules and Business Logic

- Rolling window starts at month index 3 (0-based); months 0–2 used only as training data
- Improvement validation window: checks `test_month`, `test_month+1`, `test_month+2` (3-month window to account for adoption lag)
- Teams with zero improvements in the 3-month window are excluded from accuracy calculation (not a model failure)
- `cancellation_check` callable is passed from `OptimizationEngine` into `BacktestEngine` and polled every 10 teams and at each month start

## Formulas / Scoring / Calculation Logic

**Overall accuracy (HR@N, i.e. Hit Rate@N / Success@N):** binary per case — 1 if *any* recommended
practice is in `actual_improved`, else 0.
```
overall_accuracy = mean(per_month_accuracy for each test month)
```

**Random baseline for HR@N** (probability of ≥1 correct recommendation by chance):
```
random_baseline = 1 − C(n − k_avg, top_n) / C(n, top_n)
```
- `n` = total number of practices
- `k_avg` = average number of improvements per team/month case
- `top_n` = number of recommendations generated
- Falls back to `min(1.0, (k_avg / n) * top_n)` if combination calculation fails

**Improvement factor:**
```
improvement_factor = overall_accuracy / random_baseline
```

### Supplementary rank-aware metrics (precision@N, recall@N, MRR)

HR@N is a standard top-N recommender metric, but it discards rank (an ordered list is
collapsed to a set before checking for a hit) and gives full credit even when only one of
`top_n` recommendations was right. `MetricsCalculator` (`src/validation/metrics.py`) already
implements the per-case pieces — `calculate_hit_rate` (precision@N) and `calculate_mrr` — and
`BacktestEngine.run_backtest()` wires them in per case, alongside a per-case recall@N calc,
aggregated the same way as accuracy (per-month mean → overall mean):

```
precision@N (case) = hits / top_n                       # MetricsCalculator.calculate_hit_rate
recall@N (case)    = hits / |actual_improved|            # hits / k for that case
mrr (case)         = 1 / rank of first hit, else 0        # MetricsCalculator.calculate_mrr
```

**Random baselines** — these are *not* the same formula as HR@N's baseline; each metric needs
its own chance-level comparison:

```
random_precision = k_avg / n     # exact — E[hits]/N is linear in k, so k_avg is safe to use
random_recall    = top_n / n     # exact — doesn't depend on k at all
random_mrr       = mean(expected_mrr_per_case)   # NOT derived from k_avg — nonlinear in k
```

`random_mrr` is computed per case (`BacktestEngine._expected_random_mrr(n, k, top_n)`) via the
negative hypergeometric rank distribution — `P(first hit at rank r) = C(n-r, k-1) / C(n, k)` —
then averaged, because averaging the *inputs* (k) first and computing MRR from `k_avg` would
give a different (wrong) answer than averaging the *outputs*.

**Two caveats when reading these numbers:**
- Recall@N is capped at `top_n / |actual_improved|` by construction — a team that improved 5
  practices can never exceed recall 0.4 at the default `top_n=2`. A low recall reflects the cap,
  not necessarily a weaker model.
- Precision@N equals HR@N only when `top_n=1`. At the default `top_n=2`, 1-of-2 correct scores
  HR@N=1.0 but precision@N=0.5 — this gap is exactly the leniency HR@N has relative to precision.

Each has a matching gap/factor field (e.g. `precision_gap`, `precision_improvement_factor`),
mirroring `improvement_gap`/`improvement_factor` for HR@N.
